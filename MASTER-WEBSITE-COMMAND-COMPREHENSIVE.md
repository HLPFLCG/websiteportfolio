### 2.9 ANIMATION GUIDELINES

**Animation Principles:**

*Purpose:*
- Guide attention
- Provide feedback
- Show relationships
- Add delight
- Improve UX

*Timing:*
- Fast: 0.1-0.2s (micro-interactions)
- Medium: 0.3-0.5s (standard transitions)
- Slow: 0.6-1.0s (page transitions)

*Easing:*
- ease-in-out: Default for most animations
- ease-out: Entering elements
- ease-in: Exiting elements
- cubic-bezier: Custom curves for specific needs

**Animation Types:**

*Fade Animations:*
```css
.fade-in {
  animation: fadeIn 0.6s ease-out;
}

@keyframes fadeIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```

*Slide Animations:*
```css
.slide-up {
  animation: slideUp 0.6s ease-out;
}

@keyframes slideUp {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(30px);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```

*Scale Animations:*
```css
.scale-in {
  animation: scaleIn 0.4s ease-out;
}

@keyframes scaleIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: scale(0.9);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: scale(1);
  }
}
```

*Hover Animations:*
```css
.hover-lift {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;
}

.hover-lift:hover {
  transform: translateY(-4px);
  box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
}
```

**Scroll Animations:**

*Using AOS (Animate On Scroll):*
```html
<!-- Fade Up -->
<div data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="600">
  Content
</div>

<!-- Fade Left -->
<div data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="600" data-aos-delay="100">
  Content
</div>

<!-- Zoom In -->
<div data-aos="zoom-in" data-aos-duration="600">
  Content
</div>
```

**Performance Considerations:**

*Do's:*
- Use transform and opacity (GPU accelerated)
- Use will-change for complex animations
- Limit simultaneous animations
- Test on low-end devices
- Provide reduced motion option

*Don'ts:*
- Don't animate width/height
- Don't animate top/left/right/bottom
- Don't use too many animations
- Don't ignore accessibility
- Don't animate on scroll (too much)

**Reduced Motion:**

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *,
  *::before,
  *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

### 2.10 RESPONSIVE DESIGN SYSTEM

**Breakpoints:**

```css
/* Mobile First Approach */

/* Extra Small (Mobile) */
/* Default styles - no media query needed */
/* 0px - 575px */

/* Small (Large Mobile) */
@media (min-width: 576px) {
  /* Styles for 576px and up */
}

/* Medium (Tablet) */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  /* Styles for 768px and up */
}

/* Large (Desktop) */
@media (min-width: 992px) {
  /* Styles for 992px and up */
}

/* Extra Large (Large Desktop) */
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  /* Styles for 1200px and up */
}

/* Extra Extra Large (Extra Large Desktop) */
@media (min-width: 1400px) {
  /* Styles for 1400px and up */
}
```

**Container Widths:**

```css
.container {
  width: 100%;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  padding-left: 16px;
  padding-right: 16px;
}

@media (min-width: 576px) {
  .container {
    max-width: 540px;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    max-width: 720px;
    padding-left: 24px;
    padding-right: 24px;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 992px) {
  .container {
    max-width: 960px;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1200px) {
  .container {
    max-width: 1140px;
    padding-left: 32px;
    padding-right: 32px;
