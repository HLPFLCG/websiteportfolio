## ABOUT PAGE COPY

### Our Story Section

**Headline:** "How It Started"

**Content:**
```
HLPFL Consulting Group was born from a simple observation: great websites shouldn't cost $20,000 or take six months to build.

As a web developer, I saw too many talented entrepreneurs held back by their online presence. They had amazing businesses, but their websites didn't reflect their quality. When they looked into professional web design, they faced two bad options: cheap template sites that looked generic, or expensive agency projects that took forever and blew their budgets.

There had to be a better way.

I spent years refining a process that delivers agency-quality websites at a fraction of the cost and time. By focusing on what matters—custom design, clean code, and real results—I eliminated the bloat that makes traditional web development so expensive and slow.

Today, HLPFL Consulting Group helps entrepreneurs across the country build professional online presences that actually work. We've delivered 500+ websites, helped generate over $50 million in client revenue, and maintained a 98% client retention rate.

Our mission is simple: help entrepreneurs get high-quality websites with low turnaround times at a fraction of typical market prices. No compromises on quality. No endless timelines. No surprise costs. Just honest, professional web development that respects your time and budget.
```

```

```
Speed Matters

We respect your time. Our streamlined process delivers professional results in days, not months. You'll never wonder what's happening with your project—we provide regular updates and clear timelines.

Fast doesn't mean rushed. It means efficient, focused, and optimized for results.

```
Fair Pricing

Great websites shouldn't cost $20,000. We've optimized our process to deliver premium quality at accessible prices. No hidden fees, no surprise costs, no budget-busting change orders.

You'll know exactly what you're paying for and what you're getting. Transparency is part of our service.
```

```
